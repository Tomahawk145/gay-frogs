After this discovery the US Government started a top-secret trial of the new formula by spraying it in chemtrails over rural US towns to monitor its effects."

        "body": "The experiment was deemed a great success in controlling the thoughts and opinions of weak-minded people, with some even theorising that the formula was used as recently as the 2016 election. But when the chemtrail solution was mixed with certain nitrates found in swamp water, the new formula made for mind control was reverted back to the G.A.Y bomb formula. "

        "body": "This caused adverse effects for most aquatic life living in the affected swamps, causing chemical imbalance and even death in some types of fish and birds. But surprisingly the chemical's effect on amphibians was incredibly similar to the effect on humans and remarkably increased the IQ of the effected by 2000%. The government then pulled out of the experiment, but not before trying to cover up their actions."
