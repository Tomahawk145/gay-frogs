    <p class="author">By Jane Austen</p>
    <div>
      <p>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in  possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.</p>
      <p>However little known the feelings or views of such a man may  be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the  minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property  of some one or other of their daughters.</p>
      <p>&quot;My dear Mr. Bennet,&quot; said his lady to him one  day, &quot;have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?&quot;</p>
      <p>Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.</p>

    <h1 data-aos="fade-down-left">The War Of The Worlds</h1>
    <p class="author">By H. G. Wells</p>
    <div>
      <p>No one would have believed in the last years of the  nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by  intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own; that as men  busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and  studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise  the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With  infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little  affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire over matter.</p>

    <h1 data-aos="flip-right"> Twenty Thousand  Leagues Under The Sea</h1>
    <p class="author">By Jules Verne</p>
    <div>
      <p>The year 1866 was signalised by a remarkable incident, a  mysterious and puzzling phenomenon, which doubtless no one has yet forgotten.  Not to mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the  public mind, even in the interior of continents, seafaring men were  particularly excited. Merchants, common sailors, captains of vessels, skippers,  both of Europe and America, naval officers of all countries, and the  Governments of several States on the two continents, were deeply interested in  the matter. </p>
